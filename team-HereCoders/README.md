## Project Overview

This project is bootstrapped with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app) and uses [Expo Router](https://expo.github.io/router/docs) for file-based routing. It integrates Firebase for authentication and backend services and MongoDB/Mongoose for database management on the backend server.

The app is designed to run seamlessly across Android, iOS, and web platforms.

---

## Features

- File-based routing with Expo Router
- Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database integration
- Async Storage for local data persistence
- Secure storage with Expo Secure Store
- Location and image picker support using Expo APIs
- Web, iOS, and Android support with one codebase
- Backend powered by Express with MongoDB and Mongoose
- JWT based authentication handling
- UI enhanced with vector icons and blur effects
- Robust state and network request handling with axios

- `express` - Node.js backend framework
- `mongodb` & `mongoose` - MongoDB ODM for database operations
- `jsonwebtoken` - JWT handling for secure authentication
- `bcrypt` - Password hashing

### Utilities

- `eslint` & `eslint-config-expo` - Linting and code quality tools
- Babel core for JS compilation

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommended version >= 18)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli` recommended)
- Android Studio or Xcode for native simulators/emulators (optional)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reprojhackathon.git
cd reprojhackathon
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

---

## Running the Project

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
expo start
```

This will open the Expo developer tools in your browser where you can:

- Run the app on an Android emulator or device
- Run the app on an iOS simulator or device
- Open the app in Expo Go (mobile app)
- Run the app on web

You can also use the scripts:

- `npm run android` â€” open Android emulator/device
- `npm run ios` â€” open iOS simulator/device
- `npm run web` â€” open the project in a web browser

---

## Resetting the Project

If you want to reset the project to a fresh state (removing all your current app code and starting from scratch):

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This moves your current app code to an `app-example` directory and creates a new blank `app` directory to start fresh.
