# üó∫Ô∏è AI-Driven Map Update from Crowd-Sourced Data

## Overview

This project demonstrates an AI-first pipeline for creating and updating digital maps using crowd-sourced and sensor-based data. Traditional map-making processes rely heavily on manual curation and rule-based systems. In contrast, this solution leverages Generative AI, Computer Vision, and LLMs (Large Language Models) to extract, enrich, validate, and visualize geospatial data automatically.

By integrating data from sources like Swiggy metadata, satellite and street-view imagery, and Overpass GPS traces, we aim to build an intelligent, scalable system that produces accurate, semantically rich, and up-to-date digital maps.

## üîß Key Features

1. NLP-based address extraction and geocoding from real-world metadata
2. Satellite and street-view imagery retrieval based on geo-coordinates
3. Feature extraction using state-of-the-art vision models:
   - SAM for building segmentation
   - Mask2Former for road segmentation
   - YOLOv8 for object, crowd and traffic detection
4. Semantic analysis using LLMs to generate meaningful tags (e.g., "busy intersection")
5. Anomaly detection and correction using LLM + AdalFlow
6. Interactive visualization using GeoJSON and HERE Vector Map API
7. Multi-timestamp analysis for temporal context

## üõ†Ô∏è Pipeline Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing

Identified that 3 types of raw data can be used: metadata, satellite imagery, and street view images.
- Swiggy restaurant metadata was collected
- NLP used to extract addresses, which were then geocoded into lat/lon
- Created initial POI layer in GeoJSON format

</div>

### 2. Imagery Collection

- Coordinates used to fetch satellite imagery
- Street-view images gathered using Capillary API

### 3. Feature Detection

- Satellite imagery passed through SAM for building footprints
- Road segmentation via Mask2Former on Street View images
- Object & traffic detection via YOLOv8 (people, signals, traffic, vehicles) on Street View images

</div>

### 4. Semantic Labelling/Enrichment

- Vision outputs or features across YOLOv8 and Mask2Former models that are extracted are analyzed by an LLM
- LLM converted low-level features into contextual tags (e.g., "signalized busy road")
- These insights were embedded in the GeoJSON properties

### 5. Anomaly Detection & Correction

- LLM + AdalFlow used to identify spatial inconsistencies or misclassifications
- Automatically corrected errors in coordinates, labels, and missing attributes
